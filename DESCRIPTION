Title: Make DenseLines Heatmaps with 'ggplot2'
Version: 0.2.0
Description: Visualise overlapping time series lines as a heatmap of line
    density. Provides a 'ggplot2' statistic implementing the DenseLines
    algorithm, which "normalizes time series by the arc length to compute
    accurate densities"
